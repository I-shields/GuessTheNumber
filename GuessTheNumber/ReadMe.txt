find out how to generate a random number
Use while loops???
while(Win == False)??
also need to tell the player if the random number is higher or lower

Took several minutes to learn about the srand, and rand function. Also took a couple of minutes to learn about the time.h function. I'm using time(0) in srand to return the current time so that every time the program runs the random number (RN) is different.
To run this program, hit start, and enter a number between 0 and the value it gives you, keep guessing based on the feedback the program gives you.

to change the range of random numbers, change the value associated with MaxNum.
